What is sorting?

Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the itmes are in some kind of order.

Examples:
Sorting numbers form smallest to largest
Sorting name alpphaetically
Sorting movies based on release year
Sorting movies based on revenue

Build-in javascript methods:

arr.sort()

- The build-in sort method accepts an optional comparator function
- You can use this comparator function to tell javascript how you want it to sort
- The comparator looks at points of elements (a and b), determines their sort based on the return value
  - if it returns a negative number, a should come before b
  - if it returns a positive number, a should come after b
  - if it returns 0, a and b are the same as far as the sort is concerned
