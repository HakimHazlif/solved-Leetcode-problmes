Bubble sort:
A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up the top

Pseudocode:
- Start loopin from with a variable called i the end of the array towards the beginning
- Start an inner loop with a variable called j from the beginning until i - 1
- if arr[i] is greater than arr[j+1], swap those two values
- return the sorted array
